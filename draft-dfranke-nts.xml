        [[SEE https://github.com/dfoxfranke/nts FOR AN UP-TO-MINUTE
        DRAFT OF THIS MEMO, AND https://github.com/dfoxfranke/nts/issues
        FOR A LIST OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES.]]
      </t>
      <t>
        This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a mechanism
        for using <xref target="RFC6347">Datagram Transport Layer
        Security</xref> (DTLS) to provide cryptographic security for
        network time synchronization. A complete specification is
        provided for applying NTS to the <xref target="RFC5905">Network
        Time Protocol</xref>. Certain sections, however, are not
        inherently NTP-specific and include guidance on how future
        work may apply them to other time synchronization protocols
        such as the <xref target="IEC.61588_2009">Precision Time
        Protocol</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The Network Time Protocol includes many different operating
        modes to support various network topologies. In addition to
        its best-known and most-widely-used client/server mode, it
        also includes modes for synchronization between symmetric
        peers, a broadcast mode, and a control mode for server
        monitoring and administration. These various modes have
        differing and contradictory requirements for security and
        performance. Symmetric and control modes demand mutual
        authentication and mutual replay protection, and for certain
        message types control mode may require confidentiality as well
        as authentication. Client/server mode places more stringent
        requirements on resource utilization than other modes, because
        servers may have  vast number of clients and be unable to afford
        to maintain per-client state. However, client/server mode also
        has more relaxed security needs, because only the client requires
        replay protection: it is harmless for servers to process
        replayed packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        The security demands of symmetric and control modes are in
        conflict with the resource-utilization demands of client/server
        mode any scheme which provides replay protection inherently
        involves maintaining some state to keep track of what messages
        have already been seen. Since therefore no single approach can
        simultaneously satisfy the needs of all modes, Network Time
        Security consists of not one protocol but a suite of them:
        <list>
          <t>
            The &quot;DTLS-encapsulated NTPv4&quot; protocol is little
            more than &quot;NTP over DTLS&quot;: the two endpoints
            perform a DTLS handshake and then exchange NTP packets
            encapsulated as DTLS Application Data. It is suitable for
            symmetric and control modes, and is also secure for
            client/server mode but relatively wasteful of server
            resources.
          </t>
          <t>
            The &quot;NTS Key Establishment&quot; protocol (NTS-KE) uses
            TLS to establish key material and negotiate some additional
            protocol options, but then quickly closes the TLS channel
            and does not use it for the exchange of time packets. NTS-KE
            is designed to be extensible, and might be extended to
            support key establishment for other protocols such as PTP.
          </t>
          <t>
            The "NTS extensions for NTPv4" are a collection of NTP
            extension fields for cryptographically securing NTPv4 using
            key material previously negotiated using NTS-KE. They are
            suitable for securing client/server mode because the server
            can implement them without retaining per-client state, but
            on the other hand are suitable *only* for client/server mode
            because only the client, and not the server, is protected
            from replay.

    <section title="TLS profile for Network Time Security" anchor="tls-profile">
      <t>
        Network Time Security makes use of both TLS (for NTS Key
        Establishment) and DTLS (for DTLS-encapsulated NTPv4). In
        either case, the requirements and recommendations of this
        section are similar. The notation &quot;(D)TLS&quot; refers to
        both TLS and DTLS.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since securing time protocols is (as of 2017) a novel
        application of (D)TLS, no backward-compatibility concerns exist
        to justify using obsolete, insecure, or otherwise broken TLS
        features or versions. We therefore put forward the following
        requirements and guidelines, roughly representing 2017's best
        practices.
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations MUST NOT negotiate (D)TLS versions
        earlier than 1.2.
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations willing to negotiate more than one possible
        version of (D)TLS SHOULD NOT respond to handshake failures by
        retrying with a downgraded protocol version. If they do, they
        MUST implement <xref target="RFC7507"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        (D)TLS clients MUST NOT offer, and DTLS servers MUST not select,
        RC4 cipher suites. <xref target="RFC7465"/>
      </t>
      <t>
        (D)TLS clients SHOULD offer, and (D)TLS servers SHOULD accept, the
        <xref target="RFC5746">TLS Renegotiation Indication
        Extension</xref>. Regardless, they MUST NOT initiate or permit
        insecure renegotiation. (*)
      </t>
      <t>
        (D)TLS clients SHOULD offer, and (D)TLS servers SHOULD accept, the
        <xref target="RFC7627">TLS Session Hash and Extended Master
        Secret Extension</xref>. (*)
      </t>
      <t>
        Use of the <xref target="RFC7301">Application-Layer Protocol
        Negotation Extension</xref> is integral to NTS and support for
        it is REQUIRED for interoperability.
      </t>
      <t>
        (*): Note that (D)TLS 1.3 or beyond may render the indicated
        recommendations inapplicable.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="The DTLS-encapsulated NTPv4 protocol">
      <t>
        The DTLS-encapsulated NTPv4 protocol is conducted on UDP port [TBD].
      </t>
      <t>
        The DTLS-encapsulated NTPv4 protocol proceeds in two parts. 
        First, DTLS handshake records are exchanged using one of the 
        two transport mechanisms specified in <xref target="transport-mechanisms"/>.
        The two endpoints carry out a DTLS handshake in conformance with <xref
        target="tls-profile"/>, with the client offering (via an <xref
        target="RFC7301">ALPN</xref> extension), and the server
        accepting, an application-layer protocol of &quot;ntp/4&quot;.
        Second, once the handshake is successfully completed, the two
        endpoints use the established channel to exchange arbitrary
        NTPv4 packets as DTLS-protected Application Data.
      </t>
      <t>
        In addition to the requirements specified in <xref
        target="tls-profile"/>, implementations MUST enforce the
        anti-replay mechanism specified in <xref target="RFC6347">
        Section 4.1.2.6 of RFC 6347</xref> (or an equivalent mechanism
        specified in a subsequent revision of DTLS). Servers wishing
        to enforce access control SHOULD either demand a client
        certificate or use a PSK-based handshake in order to establish
        the client's identity.
      </t>
      <t>
        The DTLS-encapsulated NTPv4 protocol is the RECOMMENDED
        mechanism for cryptographically securing mode 1 (symmetric
        active), 2 (symmetric passive), and 6 (control) NTPv4 traffic.
        It is equally safe for mode 3/4 (client/server) traffic, but
        is NOT RECOMMENDED for this purpose because it scales poorly
        compared to using <xref target="nts-extensions-for-ntpv4">NTS
        Extensions for NTPv4</xref>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="The NTS Key Establishment protocol">
      <t>
        
      </t>
      <t>
        The NTS key establishment protocol is conducted via TCP port
        [TBD].  The two endpoints carry out a TLS handshake in
        conformance with <xref target="tls-profile"/>, with the client
        offering (via an <xref target="RFC7301">ALPN</xref>
        extension), and the server accepting, an application-layer
        protocol of &quot;ntske/1&quot;.  Immediately following a
        successful handshake, the client SHALL send a single request
        (as Application Data encapsulated in the TLS-protected
        channel), then the server SHALL send a single response
        followed by a TLS "Close notify" alert and then discard the
        channel state.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client's request and the server's response each SHALL
        consist of a sequence of records formatted according to <xref
        target="ntske-record"/>. The sequence SHALL be terminated by a
        &quot;End of Message&quot; record, which has a Record Type of
        zero and a zero-length body. Furthermore, requests and
        non-error responses each SHALL include exactly one NTS Next
        Protocol Negotiation record.

            request and response. Its body consists of a sequence of
            16-octet strings. Each 16-octet string represents a

            the algorithms offered.. In requests, the list MUST
            include at least one algorithm. In responses, it MUST
            include at most one. Honoring the client's preference
            order is OPTIONAL: servers may select among any of the

          The Unique Identifier extension provides the client with a

          packets. It may also be used standalone, without NTS, in
          which case it provides the client with a means of detecting
          spoofed packets from off-path attackers. Historically, NTP's
          origin timestamp field has played both these roles, but for
          cryptographic purposes this is suboptimal because it is only
          64 bits long and, depending on implementation details, most
          of those bits may be predictable. In contrast, the Unique
          Identifier extension enables a degree of unpredictability

          best practice.

          but not encrypted), within it (therefore encrypted and
          authenticated), or after it (therefore neither encrypted nor
          authenticated). In general, however, the client MUST discard
          any unauthenticated extensions and process the packet as
          though they were not present. Clients MAY implement
          exceptions to this requirement for particular extensions
          if their specification explicitly provides for such.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the server is unable to validate the cookie or
          authenticate the request, it SHOULD respond with a
          Kiss-o'-Death packet (see <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905,
          Section 7.4)</xref>) with kiss code &quot;NTSN&quot;
          (meaning &quot;NTS NAK&quot;). Such a response MUST
          include exactly one Unique Identifier extension whose
          contents SHALL echo those provided by the client.  It MUST
          NOT include any NTS Cookie or NTS Authenticator and
          Encrypted Extensions extension. [[Ed. Note: RFC 5905 already
          provides the kiss code &quot;CRYP&quot; meaning
          &quot;Cryptographic authentication or identification failed&quot;
          but I think this is meant to be Autokey-specific.]]
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS-protected response, the client MUST
          verify that the Unique Identifier matches that of an
          outstanding request, and that the packet is authentic under
          the S2C key associated with that request. If either of these
          checks fails, the packet MUST be discarded without further
          processing.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS NAK, the client MUST verify that the
          Unique Identifier matches that of an outstanding request. If
          this check fails, the packet MUST be discarded without
          further processing. If this check passes, the client SHOULD
          discard all cookies and AEAD keys associated with the server
          which sent the NAK and initiate a fresh NTS-KE handshake.

    <section title="Recommended format for NTS cookies" anchor="recommended-format-for-nts-cookies">
      <t>
        This section provides a RECOMMENDED way for servers to
        construct NTS cookies. Clients MUST NOT examine the cookie
        under the assumption that it is constructed according to this
        section.
      </t>
      <t>
        The role of cookies in NTS is closely analagous to that of
        session cookies in TLS. Accordingly, the thematic resemblance
        of this section to <xref target="RFC5077">RFC 5077</xref> is
        deliberate, and the reader should likewise take heed of its
        security considerations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should select an AEAD algorithm which they will use to
        encrypt and authenticate cookies. The chosen algorithm should
        be one such as <xref
        target="RFC5297">AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256</xref> which resists
        accidential nonce reuse, and it need not be the same as the
        one that was negotiated with the client. Servers should
        randomly generate and store a master AEAD key `K`. Servers
        should additionally choose a non-secret, unique value `I` as
        key-identifier for `K`.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should periodically (e.g., once daily) generate a new
        pair (I,K) and immediately switch to using these values for
        all newly-generated cookies. Immediately following each such
        key rotation, servers should securely erase any keys generated
        two or more rotation periods prior. Servers should continue to
        accept any cookie generated using keys that they have not yet
        erased, even if those keys are no longer current. Erasing old
        keys provides for forward secrecy, limiting the scope of what
        old information can be stolen if a master key is somehow
        compromised. Holding on to a limited number of old keys allows
        clients to seamlessly transition from one generation to the
        next without having to perform a new NTS-KE handshake.
      </t>
      <t>
        [[TODO: discuss key management considerations for load-balanced
        servers]]
      </t>
      <t>
        To form a cookie, servers should first form a plaintext `P`
        consisting of the following fields:
        <list>
          <t>The AEAD algorithm negotiated during NTS-KE</t>
          <t>The S2C key</t>
          <t>The C2S key</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should the generate a nonce `N` uniformly at random,
        and form AEAD output `C` by encrypting `P` under key `K` with
        nonce `N` and no associated data.
      </t>
      <t>
        The cookie should consist of the tuple `(I,N,C)`.

            <t>
              A protocol is provided in this standard that enables
              precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and
              control systems implemented with technologies such as
              network communication, local computing, and distributed
              objects. The protocol is applicable to systems
              communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems
              are enabled that include clocks of various inherent
              precision, resolution, and stability to
              synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and
              precision in the sub-microsecond range are supported
              with minimal network and local clock computing
              resources. Simple systems are installed and operated
              without requiring the management attention of users
              because the default behavior of the protocol allows for
              it.
