        This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a mechanism
        for using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated
        Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) to provide
        cryptographic security for the client-server mode of the
        Network Time Protocol (NTP).
      </t>
      <t>
        NTS is structured as a suite of two loosely coupled sub-protocols. 
        The first (NTS-KE) handles initial authentication and key 
        establishment over TLS. The second handles encryption and 
        authentication during NTP time synchronization via extension fields in the 
        NTP packets, and holds all required state only on the 
        client via opaque cookies.

      <t>
	This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a
	cryptographic security mechanism for network time
	synchronization. A complete specification is provided for
	application of NTS to the client-server mode of the
        <xref target="RFC5905">Network Time Protocol (NTP)</xref>.
      </t>

      <section title="Objectives">
	<t>
	  The objectives of NTS are as follows:

	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
        Identity: Through the use of the X.509 public key infrastructure,
        implementations may cryptographically establish the identity of
        the parties they are communicating with.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Authentication: Implementations may cryptographically
	      verify that any time synchronization packets are
	      authentic, i.e., that they were produced by an
	      identified party and have not been modified in transit.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Confidentiality: Although basic time synchronization
	      data is considered non-confidential and sent in the
	      clear, NTS includes support for encrypting NTP extension
	      fields.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Replay prevention: Client implementations may detect when
	      a received time synchronization packet is a replay of
	      a previous packet.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Request-response consistency: Client implementations may
	      verify that a time synchronization packet received from
	      a server was sent in response to a particular request from
	      the client.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Unlinkability: For mobile clients, NTS will not leak any
	      information additional to NTP which would permit a
	      passive adversary to determine that two packets sent
	      over different networks came from the same client.
	    </t>
	    <t>
              Non-amplification: Implementations (especially server
              implementations) may avoid acting as distributed
              denial-of-service (DDoS) amplifiers by never responding to a
              request with a packet larger than the request packet.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Scalability: Server implementations may serve large
	      numbers of clients without having to retain any
	      client-specific state.
	    </t>
      <t>
        Resilience: Attacks on or faults in parts of the NTS
        infrastructure should not completely prohibit clients from
        performing time synchronization.
      </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Protocol Overview">
        <t>
          The Network Time Protocol includes many different operating modes to
          support various network topologies. In addition to its best-known and
          most-widely-used client-server mode, it also includes modes for
          synchronization between symmetric peers, a control mode for server
          monitoring and administration, and a broadcast mode. These various
          modes have differing and partly contradictory requirements for
          security and performance. Symmetric and control modes demand mutual
          authentication and mutual replay protection. Additionally, for certain
          message types control mode may require confidentiality as well as
          authentication. Client-server mode places more stringent requirements
          on resource utilization than other modes, because servers may have
          vast number of clients and be unable to afford to maintain per-client
          state. However, client-server mode also has more relaxed security
          needs, because only the client requires replay protection: it is
          harmless for stateless servers to process replayed packets. The
          security demands of symmetric and control modes, on the other hand,
          are in conflict with the resource-utilization demands of client-server
          mode: any scheme which provides replay protection inherently involves
          maintaining some state to keep track of what messages have already
          been seen.
        </t>

        <t>
          This memo specifies NTS exclusively for the client-server mode of NTP.
          To this end, NTS is structured as a suite of two protocols:

          <list>
            <t>
              The "NTS Extensions for NTPv4" define a collection of NTP
              extension fields for cryptographically securing NTPv4 using
              previously-established key material. They are suitable for
              securing client-server mode because the server can implement them
              without retaining per-client state. All state is kept by the
              client and provided to the server in the form of an encrypted
              cookie supplied with each request. On the other hand, the NTS
              Extension Fields are suitable *only* for client-server mode
              because only the client, and not the server, is protected from
              replay.
            </t>

            <t>
              The &quot;NTS Key Establishment&quot; protocol (NTS-KE) is a
              mechanism for establishing key material for use with the NTS
              Extension Fields for NTPv4. It uses TLS to exchange keys, provide
              the client with an initial supply of cookies, and negotiate some
              additional protocol options. After this exchange, the TLS channel
              is closed with no per-client state remaining on the server side.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The typical protocol flow is as follows: The client connects to an
          NTS-KE server on the NTS TCP port and the two parties perform a TLS
          handshake. Via the TLS channel, the parties negotiate some additional
          protocol parameters and the server sends the client a supply of
          cookies along with a list of one or more IP addresses to NTP servers
          for which the cookies are valid. The parties use
          <xref target="RFC5705">TLS key export</xref> to extract key material
          which will be used in the next phase of the protocol. This negotiation
          takes only a single round trip, after which the server closes the
          connection and discards all associated state. At this point the NTS-KE
          phase of the protocol is complete. Ideally, the client never needs to
          connect to the NTS-KE server again.
        </t>
        <t>
          Time synchronization proceeds with one of the indicated NTP servers
          over the NTP UDP port. The client sends the server an NTP client
          packet which includes several extension fields. Included among these
          fields are a cookie (previously provided by the key exchange server)
          and an authentication tag, computed using key material extracted from
          the NTS-KE handshake.  The NTP server uses the cookie to recover this
          key material and send back an authenticated response. The response
          includes a fresh, encrypted cookie which the client then sends back in
          the clear in a subsequent request. (This constant refreshing of
          cookies is necessary in order to achieve NTS's unlinkability goal.)
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="protocol-overview"/> provides an overview of the
          high-level interaction between the client, the NTS-KE server, and the
          NTP server. Note that the cookies' data format and the exchange of
          secrets between NTS-KE and NTP servers are not part of this
          specification and are implementation dependent. However, a suggested
          format for NTS cookies is provided in
          <xref target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/>.

        Since the NTS protocol is new as of this publication, no
        backward-compatibility concerns exist to justify using
        obsolete, insecure, or otherwise broken TLS features or
        versions. Implementations MUST conform with <xref

        195. In particular, failure to use cipher suites that provide forward
        secrecy will make all negotiated NTS keys recoverable by anyone
        that gains access to the NTS-KE server's private certificate.
        Furthermore:
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS versions earlier than
        1.2, SHOULD negotiate TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/> or
        later when possible, and MAY refuse to negotiate any TLS
        version which has been superseded by a later supported

        Use of the <xref target="RFC7301">Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation

    <section title="The NTS Key Establishment Protocol" anchor="nts-ke">
      <t>
        The NTS key establishment protocol is conducted via TCP port [[TBD1]].
        The two endpoints carry out a TLS handshake in conformance with
        <xref target="tls-profile"/>, with the client offering (via an
        <xref target="RFC7301">ALPN</xref> extension), and the server accepting,
        an application-layer protocol of &quot;ntske/1&quot;. Immediately
        following a successful handshake, the client SHALL send a single request
        as Application Data encapsulated in the TLS-protected channel. Then, the
        server SHALL send a single response followed by a TLS
        &quot;Close notify&quot; alert and then discard the channel state.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client's request and the server's response each SHALL consist of a
        sequence of records formatted according to
        <xref target="ntske-record"/>. Requests and non-error responses each
        SHALL include exactly one NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record. The
        sequence SHALL be terminated by a &quot;End of Message&quot; record. The
        requirement that all NTS-KE messages be terminated by an End of Message
        record makes them self-delimiting.

        Clients and servers MAY enforce length limits on requests and responses,

        `b[0] &gt;&gt; 7` while the record type is
        `((b[0] &amp; 0x7f) &lt;&lt; 8) + b[1]`.

        <t>The following NTS-KE Record Types are defined:</t>

        <section title="End of Message" anchor="end-of-message">
          <t>
            The End of Message record has a Record Type number of 0 and a
            zero-length body. It MUST occur exactly once as the final record of
            every NTS-KE request and response. The Critical Bit MUST be set.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="NTS Next Protocol Negotiation"
          anchor="nts-next-protocol-negotiation">
          <t>
            The NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record has a Record Type number
            of 1. It MUST occur exactly once in every NTS-KE request and
            response. Its body consists of a sequence of 16-bit unsigned
            integers in network byte order. Each integer represents a Protocol
            ID from the IANA Network Time Security Next Protocols registry. The
            Critical Bit MUST be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Protocol IDs listed in the client's NTS Next Protocol
            Negotiation record denote those protocols which the client wishes to
            speak using the key material established through this NTS-KE
            session. The Protocol IDs listed in the server's response MUST
            comprise a subset of those listed in the request and denote those
            protocols which the server is willing and able to speak using the
            key material established through this NTS-KE session. The client MAY
            proceed with one or more of them. The request MUST list at least one
            protocol, but the response MAY be empty.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Error" anchor="nts-error">
          <t>
            The Error record has a Record Type number of 2. Its body is exactly
            two octets long, consisting of an unsigned 16-bit integer in network
            byte order, denoting an error code. The Critical Bit MUST be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            Clients MUST NOT include Error records in their request. If clients
            receive a server response which includes an Error record, they MUST
            discard any negotiated key material and MUST NOT proceed to the Next
            Protocol.

              <t>
                Error code 0 means &quot;Unrecognized Critical Record&quot;. The
                server MUST respond with this error code if the request included
                a record which the server did not understand and which had its
                Critical Bit set. The client SHOULD NOT retry its request
                without modification.
              </t>
              <t>
                Error code 1 means &quot;Bad Request&quot;. The server MUST
                respond with this error if, upon the expiration of an
                implementation-defined timeout, it has not yet received a
                complete and syntactically well-formed request from the client.

            The Warning record has a Record Type number of 3. Its body is
            exactly two octets long, consisting of an unsigned 16-bit integer in
            network byte order, denoting a warning code. The Critical Bit MUST
            be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            Clients MUST NOT include Warning records in their request. If
            clients receive a server response which includes a Warning record,
            they MAY discard any negotiated key material and abort without
            proceeding to the Next Protocol. Unrecognized warning codes MUST be
            treated as errors.

          <t>
            The AEAD Algorithm Negotiation record has a Record Type number of 4.
            Its body consists of a sequence of unsigned 16-bit integers in
            network byte order, denoting Numeric Identifiers from the IANA
            <xref target="RFC5116">AEAD registry</xref>. The Critical Bit MAY be
            set.

          <t>
            If the NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record offers Protocol ID 0

            protocols MAY require it as well.
          </t>
          <t>
            When included in a request, this record denotes which AEAD
            algorithms the client is willing to use to secure the Next Protocol,
            in decreasing preference order. When included in a response, this
            record denotes which algorithm the server chooses to use. It is
            empty if the server supports none of the algorithms offered. In
            requests, the list MUST include at least one algorithm. In
            responses, it MUST include at most one. Honoring the client's
            preference order is OPTIONAL: servers may select among any of the
            client's offered choices, even if they are able to support some
            other algorithm which the client prefers more.

            Next Protocol Negotiation response record contains Protocol ID 0
            (NTPv4) and the AEAD Algorithm Negotiation response record is not
            empty. The Critical Bit SHOULD NOT be set.

            conforming to the syntax of the Host subcomponent of a URI

          <t>
            When NTPv4 is negotiated as a Next Protocol and this
            record is sent by the server, the body specifies the
            hostname or IP address of the NTPv4 server with which the
            client should associate and which will accept the supplied
            cookies. If no record of this type is sent, the client
            SHOULD interpret this as a directive to associate with an
            NTPv4 server at the same IP address as the NTS-KE server.
            Servers MUST NOT send more than one record of this type.

            deciding what NTPv4 Server Negotiation records to respond
            with, but honoring the client's preference is
            OPTIONAL. The client MUST NOT send more than one record of
            this type.

          <t>
            When NTPv4 is negotiated as a Next Protocol and this

            number of the NTPv4 server with which the client should
            associate and which will accept the supplied cookies. If
            no record of this type is sent, the client SHALL assume

            <t>
              Some extension fields which are authenticated but not encrypted.
            </t>
            <t>
              An extension field which contains AEAD output (i.e., an
              authentication tag and possible ciphertext). The corresponding
              plaintext, if non-empty, consists of some extension fields which
              benefit from both encryption and authentication.
            </t>
            <t>
              Possibly, some additional extension fields which are neither
              encrypted nor authenticated. These are discarded by the
              receiver.

        </t>
        <t>
          Always included among the authenticated or authenticated-and-encrypted
          extension fields are a cookie extension field and a unique identifier
          extension field. The purpose of the cookie extension field is to
          enable the server to offload storage of session state onto the client.
          The purpose of the unique identifier extension field is to protect the
          client from replay attacks.

      </section>

      <section title="The Unique Identifier Extension Field"
        anchor="unique-identifier-extension-field">
        <t>
          The Unique Identifier extension field provides the client with a
          cryptographically strong means of detecting replayed packets. It has a
          Field Type of [[TBD2]]. When the extension field is included in a
          client packet (mode 3), its body SHALL consist of a string of octets
          generated uniformly at random. The string MUST be at least 32 octets
          long. When the extension field is included in a server packet
          (mode 4), its body SHALL contain the same octet string as was provided
          in the client packet to which the server is responding. All server
          packets generated by NTS-implementing servers in response to client
          packets containing this extension field MUST also contain this field
          with the same content as in the client's request. The field's use in
          modes other than client-server is not defined.
        </t>
        <t>
          This extension field MAY also be used standalone, without NTS, in
          which case it provides the client with a means of detecting spoofed
          packets from off-path attackers. Historically, NTP's origin timestamp
          field has played both these roles, but for cryptographic purposes this
          is suboptimal because it is only 64 bits long and, depending on
          implementation details, most of those bits may be predictable. In
          contrast, the Unique Identifier extension field enables a degree of
          unpredictability and collision resistance more consistent with
          cryptographic best practice.

          The NTS Cookie extension field has a Field Type of [[TBD3]]. Its
          purpose is to carry information which enables the server to recompute
          keys and other session state without having to store any per-client
          state. The contents of its body SHALL be implementation-defined and
          clients MUST NOT attempt to interpret them. See <xref
          target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/> for a suggested
          construction.  The NTS Cookie extension field MUST NOT be included in
          NTP packets whose mode is other than 3 (client) or 4 (server).

          The NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field has a Field Type of
          [[TBD4]].  When this extension field is included in a client packet
          (mode 3), it communicates to the server that the client wishes it to
          send additional cookies in its response. This extension field MUST NOT
          be included in NTP packets whose mode is other than 3.

          Whenever an NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field is present, it MUST
          be accompanied by an NTS Cookie extension field. The body length of
          the NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field MUST be the same as the
          body length of the NTS Cookie extension field. This length requirement
          serves to ensure that the response will not be larger than the
          request, in order to improve timekeeping precision and prevent DDoS
          amplification. The contents of the NTS Cookie Placeholder extension
          field's body are undefined and, aside from checking its length, MUST
          be ignored by the server.

          The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields extension field
          is the central cryptographic element of an NTS-protected NTP packet.

          <list>

              Nonce Length: Two octets in network byte order, giving the length
              of the Nonce field, excluding any padding, interpreted as an
              unsigned integer.
            </t>
            <t>
              Ciphertext Length: Two octets in network byte order, giving the

              as an unsigned integer.
            </t>
            <t>
              Nonce: A nonce as required by the negotiated AEAD Algorithm. The
              field is zero-padded to a word (four octets) boundary.
            </t>
            <t>
              Ciphertext: The output of the negotiated AEAD Algorithm. The
              structure of this field is determined by the negotiated algorithm,
              but it typically contains an authentication tag in addition to the
              actual ciphertext. The field is zero-padded to a word (four
              octets) boundary.
            </t>

              Additional Padding: Clients which use a nonce length shorter than
              the maximum allowed by the negotiated AEAD algorithm may be required

          The Ciphertext field SHALL be formed by providing the following inputs

          <list>
            <t>
              K: For packets sent from the client to the server, the C2S key

              S2C key SHALL be used.

            <t>
              P: The plaintext SHALL consist of all (if any) NTP extension
              fields to be encrypted. The format of any such fields SHALL be in
              accordance with <xref target="RFC7822">RFC 7822</xref>. If
              multiple extension fields are present they SHALL be joined by
              concatenation.

            <t>
              N: The nonce SHALL be formed however required by the negotiated

          The purpose of the Additional Padding field is to ensure
          that servers can always choose a nonce whose length is
          adequate to ensure its uniqueness, even if the client
          chooses a shorter one, and still ensure that the overall
          length of the server's response packet does not exceed the
          length of the request. For mode 4 (server) packets, no
          Additional Padding field is ever required.  For mode 3
          (client) packets, the length of the Additional Padding field
          SHALL be computed as follows.  Let `N_LEN` be the padded
          length of the the Nonce field. Let `N_MAX` be, as specified
          by <xref target="RFC5116">RFC 5116</xref>, the maximum
          permitted nonce length for the negotiated AEAD
          algorithm. Let `N_REQ` be the lesser of 16 and N_MAX,
          rounded up to the nearest multiple of 4.  If N_LEN is
          greater than or equal to N_REQ, then no Additional Padding
          field is required. Otherwise, the Additional Padding field
          SHALL be at least N_REQ - N_LEN octets in length. Servers
          MUST enforce this requirement by discarding any packet which
          does not conform to it.
        </t>
        <t>
          The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields extension field
          MUST NOT be included in NTP packets whose mode is other than 3
          (client) or 4 (server).

          A client sending an NTS-protected request SHALL include the following

          <list>
            <t>
              Exactly one Unique Identifier extension field which MUST be
              authenticated, MUST NOT be encrypted, and whose contents MUST NOT
              duplicate those of any previous request.

            <t>
              Exactly one NTS Cookie extension field which MUST be authenticated
              and MUST NOT be encrypted. The cookie MUST be one which has been
              previously provided to the client; either from the key exchange
              server during the NTS-KE handshake or from the NTP server in
              response to a previous NTS-protected NTP request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Exactly one NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields
              extension field, generated using an AEAD Algorithm and C2S key
              established through NTS-KE.

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          To protect the client's privacy, the client SHOULD avoid reusing
          a cookie. If the client does not have any cookies that it has not
          already sent, it SHOULD initiate a re-run the NTS-KE protocol. The
          client MAY reuse cookies in order to prioritize resilience over
          unlinkability. Which of the two that should be prioritized in any
          particular case is dependent on the application and the user's
          preference. <xref target="Unlinkability"/> describes the privacy
          considerations of this in further detail.

        <t>
          The client MAY include one or more NTS Cookie Placeholder extension
          fields which MUST be authenticated and MAY be encrypted. The number of
          NTS Cookie Placeholder extension fields that the client includes
          SHOULD be such that if the client includes N placeholders and the server
          sends back N+1 cookies, the number of unused cookies stored by the
          client will come to eight. The client SHOULD NOT include more than seven
          NTS Cookie Placeholder extension fields in a request. When both the
          client and server adhere to all cookie-management guidance provided in
          this memo, the number of placeholder extension fields will equal the
          number of dropped packets since the last successful volley.

          The client MAY include additional (non-NTS-related) extension fields
          which MAY appear prior to the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension
          Fields extension fields (therefore authenticated but not encrypted),
          within it (therefore encrypted and authenticated), or after it
          (therefore neither encrypted nor authenticated). In general, however,
          the server MUST discard any unauthenticated extension fields and process
          the packet as though they were not present. Servers MAY implement
          exceptions to this requirement for particular extension fields if their
          specification explicitly provides for such.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS-protected request, the server SHALL (through some
          implementation-defined mechanism) use the cookie to recover the AEAD
          Algorithm, C2S key, and S2C key associated with the request, and then
          use the C2S key to authenticate the packet and decrypt the ciphertext.
          If the cookie is valid and authentication and decryption succeed, the

            <t>
              Exactly one NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields
              extension field, generated using the AEAD algorithm and S2C key
              recovered from the cookie provided by the client.

            <t>
              One or more NTS Cookie extension fields which MUST be authenticated

              SHOULD be equal to, and MUST NOT exceed, one plus the number of
              valid NTS Cookie Placeholder extension fields included in the
              request. The cookies returned in those fields MUST be valid for use
              with the NTP server that sent them. They MAY be valid for other NTP
              servers as well, but there is no way for the server to indicate
              this.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          We emphasize the contrast that NTS Cookie extension fields MUST NOT be
          encrypted when sent from client to server, but MUST be encrypted from
          sent from server to client. The former is necessary in order for the
          server to be able to recover the C2S and S2C keys, while the latter is
          necessary to satisfy the unlinkability goals discussed in <xref
          target="Unlinkability"/>. We emphasize also that &quot;encrypted&quot;
          means encapsulated within the the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted
          Extensions extension field. While the body of an NTS Cookie extension
          field will generally consist of some sort of AEAD output (regardless of
          whether the recommendations of <xref
          target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/> are precisely followed),
          this is not sufficient to make the extension field
          &quot;encrypted&quot;.

          The server MAY include additional (non-NTS-related) extension fields
          which MAY appear prior to the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension
          Fields extension field (therefore authenticated but not encrypted),
          within it (therefore encrypted and authenticated), or after it

        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS-protected response, the client MUST verify that
          the Unique Identifier matches that of an outstanding request, and that
          the packet is authentic under the S2C key associated with that request.
          If either of these checks fails, the packet MUST be discarded without
          further processing.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the server is unable to validate the cookie or authenticate the
          request, it SHOULD respond with a Kiss-o'-Death (KoD) packet (see
          <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905, Section 7.4</xref>) with kiss code
          &quot;NTSN&quot;, meaning &quot;NTS negative-acknowledgment
          (NAK)&quot;. It MUST NOT include any NTS Cookie or NTS Authenticator and
          Encrypted Extension Fields extension fields.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the NTP server has previously responded with authentic NTS-protected
          NTP packets (i.e., packets containing the NTS Authenticator and
          Encrypted Extension Fields extension field), the client MUST verify that
          any KoD packets received from the server contain the Unique Identifier
          extension field and that the Unique Identifier matches that of an
          outstanding request. If this check fails, the packet MUST be discarded
          without further processing. If this check passes, the client MUST comply
          with <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5095, Section 7.4</xref> where required.
          A client MAY automatically re-run the NTS-KE protocol upon forced
          disassociation from an NTP server. In that case, it MUST be able to
          detect and stop looping between the NTS-KE and NTP servers.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon reception of the NTS NAK kiss code, the client SHOULD wait until
          the next poll for a valid NTS-protected response and if none is
          received, initiate a fresh NTS-KE handshake to try to renegotiate new
          cookies, AEAD keys, and parameters. If the NTS-KE handshake succeeds,
          the client MUST discard all old cookies and parameters and use the new
          ones instead. As long as the NTS-KE handshake has not succeeded, the
          client SHOULD continue polling the NTP server using the cookies and
          parameters it has.
        </t>
        <t>
          To allow for NTP session restart when the NTS-KE server is unavailable
          and to reduce NTS-KE server load, the client SHOULD keep at least one
          unused but recent cookie, AEAD keys, negotiated AEAD algorithm, and
          other necessary parameters on persistent storage. This way, the client
          is able to resume the NTP session without performing renewed NTS-KE
          negotiation.
        </t>

    <section title="Suggested Format for NTS Cookies"
      anchor="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies">
      <t>
        This section is non-normative. It gives a suggested way for servers to
        construct NTS cookies. All normative requirements are stated in
        <xref target="new-cookie-for-ntpv4"/> and <xref
        target="nts-cookie-extension-field"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The role of cookies in NTS is closely analogous to that of session
        cookies in TLS. Accordingly, the thematic resemblance of this section to
        <xref target="RFC5077">RFC 5077</xref> is deliberate and the reader
        should likewise take heed of its security considerations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should select an AEAD algorithm which they will use to encrypt
        and authenticate cookies. The chosen algorithm should be one such as
        <xref target="RFC5297">AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256</xref> which resists
        accidental nonce reuse. It need not be the same as the one that was
        negotiated with the client. Servers should randomly generate and store a
        master AEAD key `K`. Servers should additionally choose a non-secret,
        unique value `I` as key-identifier for `K`.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should periodically (e.g., once daily) generate a new pair (I,K)
        and immediately switch to using these values for all newly-generated
        cookies. Immediately following each such key rotation, servers should
        securely erase any keys generated two or more rotation periods prior.
        Servers should continue to accept any cookie generated using keys that
        they have not yet erased, even if those keys are no longer current.
        Erasing old keys provides for forward secrecy, limiting the scope of
        what old information can be stolen if a master key is somehow
        compromised. Holding on to a limited number of old keys allows clients
        to seamlessly transition from one generation to the next without having
        to perform a new NTS-KE handshake.
      </t>
      <t>
        The need to keep keys synchronized between NTS-KE and NTP servers as
        well as across load-balanced clusters can make automatic key rotation
        challenging. However, the task can be accomplished without the need for
        central key-management infrastructure by using a ratchet, i.e., making
        each new key a deterministic, cryptographically pseudo-random function
        of its predecessor. A recommended concrete implementation of this
        approach is to use <xref target="RFC5869">HKDF</xref> to derive new
        keys, using the key's predecessor as Input Keying Material and its key
        identifier as a salt.
      </t>
      <t>
        To form a cookie, servers should first form a plaintext `P` consisting
        of the following fields:
        <list>
          <t>The AEAD algorithm negotiated during NTS-KE.</t>
          <t>The S2C key.</t>
          <t>The C2S key.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should then generate a nonce `N` uniformly at random, and form
        AEAD output `C` by encrypting `P` under key `K` with nonce `N` and no
        associated data.
      </t>
      <t>
        Upon reception of the NTS NAK kiss code, the client SHOULD wait until
        the next poll for a valid NTS-protected response and if none is
        received, initiate a fresh NTS-KE handshake to try to renegotiate new
        cookies, AEAD keys, and parameters. If the NTS-KE handshake succeeds,
        the client MUST discard all old cookies and parameters and use the new
        ones instead. As long as the NTS-KE handshake has not succeeded, the
        client SHOULD continue polling the NTP server using the cookies and
        parameters it has.
      </t>
      <t>
        To verify and decrypt a cookie provided by the client, first parse it
        into its components `I`, `N`, and `C`. Use `I` to look up its decryption
        key `K`. If the key whose identifier is `I` has been erased or never
        existed, decryption fails; reply with an NTS NAK. Otherwise, attempt to
        decrypt and verify ciphertext `C` using key `K` and nonce `N` with no
        associated data. If decryption or verification fails, reply with an NTS
        NAK. Otherwise, parse out the contents of the resulting plaintext `P` to
        obtain the negotiated AEAD algorithm, S2C key, and C2S key.

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <section title="Sensitivity to DDoS attacks">
        <t>
          The introduction of NTS brings with it the introduction of asymmetric
          cryptography to NTP. Asymmetric cryptography is necessary for initial
          server authentication and AEAD key extraction. Asymmetric
          cryptosystems are generally orders of magnitude slower than their
          symmetric counterparts. This makes it much harder to build systems
          that can serve requests at a rate corresponding to the full line speed
          of the network connection. This, in turn, opens up a new possibility
          for DDoS attacks on NTP services.
        </t>
        <t>
          The main protection against these attacks in NTS lies in that the use
          of asymmetric cryptosystems is only necessary in the initial NTS-KE
          phase of the protocol. Since the protocol design enables separation of
          the NTS-KE and NTP servers, a successful DDoS attack on an NTS-KE
          server separated from the NTP service it supports will not affect NTP
          users that have already performed initial authentication, AEAD key
          extraction, and cookie exchange. <!--Furthermore, as noted in
          <xref target="usage-of-ntp-pools"/>, NTP-KE capacity is easier to
          scale up and down than NTP server capacity.-->
        </t>
        <t>
          NTS users should also consider that they are not fully protected
          against DDoS attacks by on-path adversaries. In addition to dropping
          packets and attacks such as those described in
          <xref target="DelayAttack"/>, an on-path attacker can send spoofed
          kiss-o'-death replies, which are not authenticated, in response to NTP
          requests. This could result in significantly increased load on the
          NTS-KE server. Implementers have to weigh the user's need for
          unlinkability against the added resilience that comes with cookie
          reuse in cases of NTS-KE server unavailability.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Avoiding DDoS Amplification">
        <t>
          Certain non-standard and/or deprecated features of the Network Time
          Protocol enable clients to send a request to a server which causes the
          server to send a response much larger than the request. Servers which
          enable these features can be abused in order to amplify traffic volume
          in DDoS attacks by sending them a request with a spoofed source IP. In
          recent years, attacks of this nature have become an endemic nuisance.
        </t>
        <t>
          NTS is designed to avoid contributing any further to this problem by
          ensuring that NTS-related extension fields included in server
          responses will be the same size as the NTS-related extension fields
          sent by the client. In particular, this is why the client is required
          to send a separate and appropriately padded-out NTS Cookie Placeholder
          extension field for every cookie it wants to get back, rather than
          being permitted simply to specify a desired quantity.
        </t>
        <t>
          Due to the <xref target="RFC7822">RFC 7822</xref> requirement that
          extensions be padded and aligned to four-octet boundaries, response
          size may still in some cases exceed request size by up to three
          octets. This is sufficiently inconsequential that we have declined to
          address it.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Initial Verification of Server Certificates">
        <t>
          NTS's security goals are undermined if the client fails to verify that
          the X.509 certificate chain presented by the NTS-KE server is valid
          and rooted in a trusted certificate authority. <xref
          target="RFC5280">RFC 5280</xref> and <xref target="RFC6125"> RFC
          6125</xref> specify how such verification is to be performed in
          general. However, the expectation that the client does not yet have a
          correctly-set system clock at the time of certificate verification
          presents difficulties with verifying that the certificate is within
          its validity period, i.e., that the current time lies between the
          times specified in the certificate's notBefore and notAfter fields. It
          may be operationally necessary in some cases for a client to accept a
          certificate which appears to be expired or not yet valid. While there
          is no perfect solution to this problem, there are several mitigations
          the client can implement to make it more difficult for an adversary to
          successfully present an expired certificate:
          <list>
            <t>
              Check whether the system time is in fact unreliable. If the system
              clock has previously been synchronized since last boot, then on
              operating systems which implement a kernel-based phase-locked-loop
              API, a call to ntp_gettime() should show a maximum error less than
              NTP_PHASE_MAX. In this case, the clock SHOULD be considered
              reliable and certificates can be strictly validated.
            </t>
            <t>
              Allow the system administrator to specify that certificates should
              *always* be strictly validated. Such a configuration is
              appropriate on systems which have a battery-backed clock and which
              can reasonably prompt the user to manually set an
              approximately-correct time if it appears to be needed.
            </t>
            <t>
              Once the clock has been synchronized, periodically write the
              current system time to persistent storage. Do not accept any
              certificate whose notAfter field is earlier than the last recorded
              time.
            </t>
            <t>
              Do not process time packets from servers if the time computed from
              them falls outside the validity period of the server's
              certificate. However, clients SHOULD NOT perform a new NTS-KE
              handshake solely based on the fact that the certificate used by
              the NTS-KE server in a previous handshake has expired, if the
              client has previously received valid NTS protected NTP replies
              that lie within the certificate's validity time.
            </t>
            <t>
              Use multiple time sources. The ability to pass off an expired
              certificate is only useful to an adversary who has compromised the
              corresponding private key. If the adversary has compromised only a
              minority of servers, NTP's selection algorithm (<xref
              target="RFC5905">RFC 5905 section 11.2.1</xref>) will protect the
              client from accepting bad time from the adversary-controlled
              servers.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="DelayAttack" title="Delay Attacks">
        <t>
          In a packet delay attack, an adversary with the ability to act as a
          man-in-the-middle delays time synchronization packets between client
          and server asymmetrically <xref target="RFC7384"/>. Since NTP's
          formula for computing time offset relies on the assumption that
          network latency is roughly symmetrical, this leads to the client to
          compute an inaccurate value <xref target="Mizrahi"/>. The delay attack
          does not reorder or modify the content of the exchanged
          synchronization packets. Therefore, cryptographic means do not provide
          a feasible way to mitigate this attack. However, the maximum error
          that an adversary can introduce is bounded by half of the round trip
          delay.
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref> specifies a parameter called
          MAXDIST which denotes the maximum round-trip latency (including not
          only the immediate round trip between client and server, but the whole
          distance back to the reference clock as reported in the Root Delay
          field) that a client will tolerate before concluding that the server
          is unsuitable for synchronization. The standard value for MAXDIST is
          one second, although some implementations use larger values. Whatever
          value a client chooses, the maximum error which can be introduced by a
          delay attack is MAXDIST/2.
        </t>
        <t>
          Usage of multiple time sources, or multiple network paths to a given
          time source <xref target="Shpiner"/>, may also serve to mitigate delay
          attacks if the adversary is in control of only some of the paths.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Random Number Generation">
        <t>
          At various points in NTS, the generation of cryptographically secure
          random numbers is required. Whenever this draft specifies the use of
          random numbers, cryptographically secure random number generation MUST
          be used. <xref target="RFC4086">RFC 4086</xref> contains guidelines
          concerning this topic.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="NTS Stripping">
        <t>
          Implementers must be aware of the possibility of "NTS stripping"
          attacks, where an attacker tricks clients into reverting to plain
          NTP. Naive client implementations might, for example, revert
          automatically if the NTS-KE handshake fails. A man-in-the-middle
          attacker can easily cause this to happen. Even clients that already
          hold valid cookies can be vulnerable, since an attacker can force a
          client to reperform the NTS-KE handshake by sending faked NTP mode 4
          replies with the NTS NAK kiss code. Forcing a client to reperform the
          NTS-KE handshake can also be the first step in more advanced attacks.
        </t>
        <t>
          For the reasons described here, implementations SHOULD NOT revert
          from NTS-protected to unprotected NTP with any server without
          explicit user action.
        </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <section title="Unlinkability" anchor="Unlinkability">
        <t>
          Unlinkability prevents a device from being tracked when it changes
          network addresses (e.g., because said device moved between different
          networks). In other words, unlinkability thwarts an attacker that
          seeks to link a new network address used by a device with a network
          address that it was formerly using through recognizable data that the
          device persistently sends as part of an NTS-secured NTP association.
          This is the justification for continually supplying the client with
          fresh cookies, so that a cookie never represents recognizable data in
          the sense outlined above.
        </t>
        <t>
          NTS's unlinkability objective is merely to not leak any additional
          data that could be used to link a device's network address. NTS does
          not rectify legacy linkability issues that are already present in NTP.
          Thus, a client that requires unlinkability must also minimize
          information transmitted in a client query (mode 3) packet as described
          in the <xref target="I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization">NTP Client Data
          Minimization Internet-Draft</xref>.
        </t>
        <t>
          The unlinkability objective only holds for time synchronization
          traffic, as opposed to key exchange traffic. This implies that it
          cannot be guaranteed for devices that function not only as time
          clients, but also as time servers (because the latter can be
          externally triggered to send authentication data).
        </t>
        <t>
          It should also be noted that it could be possible to link devices that
          operate as time servers from their time synchronization traffic, using
          information exposed in (mode 4) server response packets (e.g.,
          reference ID, reference time, stratum, poll). Also, devices that
          respond to NTP control queries could be linked using the information
          revealed by control queries.

      <section title="Confidentiality">
        <t>
          NTS does not protect the confidentiality of information in NTP's
          header fields. When clients implement <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization">NTP Client Data
          Minimization</xref>, client packet headers do not contain any
          information which the client could conceivably wish to keep secret:
          one field is random and all others are fixed. Information in server
          packet headers is likewise public: the origin timestamp is copied from
          the client's (random) transmit timestamp and all other fields are set
          the same regardless of the identity of the client making the request.
        </t>
        <t>
          Future extension fields could hypothetically contain sensitive
          information, in which case NTS provides a mechanism for encrypting
          them.
