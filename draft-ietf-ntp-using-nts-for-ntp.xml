        This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a mechanism for using
        Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated Encryption with
        Associated Data (AEAD) to provide cryptographic security for the
        client-server mode of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
      </t>
      <t>
        NTS is structured as a suite of two loosely coupled sub-protocols: the
        NTS Key Establishment Protocol (NTS-KE) and the NTS Extension Fields for
        NTPv4. NTS-KE handles NTS service authentication, initial handshaking,
        and key extraction over TLS. Encryption and authentication during NTP
        time synchronization is performed through the NTS Extension Fields in
        otherwise standard NTP packets. Except for during the initial NTS-KE
        process, all state required by the protocol is held by the client in
        opaque cookies.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	This memo specifies Network Time Security (NTS), a
	cryptographic security mechanism for network time
	synchronization. A complete specification is provided for
	application of NTS to the client-server mode of the
  <xref target="RFC5905">Network Time Protocol (NTP)</xref>.
      </t>

      <section title="Objectives">
	<t>
	  The objectives of NTS are as follows:

	  <list style="symbols">
	    <t>
        Identity: Through the use of the X.509 public key infrastructure,
        implementations may cryptographically establish the identity of
        the parties they are communicating with.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Authentication: Implementations may cryptographically
	      verify that any time synchronization packets are
	      authentic, i.e., that they were produced by an
	      identified party and have not been modified in transit.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Confidentiality: Although basic time synchronization
	      data is considered non-confidential and sent in the
	      clear, NTS includes support for encrypting NTP extension
	      fields.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Replay prevention: Client implementations may detect when
	      a received time synchronization packet is a replay of
	      a previous packet.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Request-response consistency: Client implementations may
	      verify that a time synchronization packet received from
	      a server was sent in response to a particular request from
	      the client.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Unlinkability: For mobile clients, NTS will not leak any
	      information additional to NTP which would permit a passive adversary to
	      determine that two packets sent over different networks
	      came from the same client.
	    </t>
	    <t>
        Non-amplification: Implementations (especially server
        implementations) may avoid acting as distributed
        denial-of-service (DDoS) amplifiers by never responding to a
        request with a packet larger than the request packet.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Scalability: Server implementations may serve large
	      numbers of clients without having to retain any
	      client-specific state.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Protocol Overview">
        <t>
          The Network Time Protocol includes many different operating modes to
          support various network topologies. In addition to its best-known and
          most-widely-used client-server mode, it also includes modes for
          synchronization between symmetric peers, a control mode for server
          monitoring and administration, and a broadcast mode. These various
          modes have differing and partly contradictory requirements for
          security and performance. Symmetric and control modes demand mutual
          authentication and mutual replay protection. Additionally, for certain
          message types control mode may require confidentiality as well as
          authentication. Client-server mode places more stringent requirements
          on resource utilization than other modes, because servers may have
          vast number of clients and be unable to afford to maintain per-client
          state. However, client-server mode also has more relaxed security
          needs, because only the client requires replay protection: it is
          harmless for stateless servers to process replayed packets. The
          security demands of symmetric and control modes, on the other hand,
          are in conflict with the resource-utilization demands of client-server
          mode: any scheme which provides replay protection inherently involves
          maintaining some state to keep track of what messages have already
          been seen.
        </t>

        <t>
          This memo specifies NTS exclusively for the client-server mode of NTP.
          To this end, NTS is structured as a suite of two protocols:

          <list>
            <t>
              The "NTS Extension Fields for NTPv4" are a collection of NTP
              extension fields for cryptographically securing NTPv4 using
              previously-established key material. They are suitable for
              securing client-server mode because the server can implement them
              without retaining per-client state. All state is kept by the
              client and provided to the server in the form of an encrypted
              cookie supplied with each request. On the other hand, the NTS
              Extension Fields are suitable *only* for client-server mode
              because only the client, and not the server, is protected from
              replay.
            </t>

            <t>
              The &quot;NTS Key Establishment&quot; protocol (NTS-KE) is a
              mechanism for establishing key material for use with the NTS
              Extension Fields for NTPv4. It uses TLS to exchange keys, provide
              the client with an initial supply of cookies, and negotiate some
              additional protocol options. After this exchange, the TLS channel
              is closed with no per-client state remaining on the server side.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          The typical protocol flow is as follows: The client connects to an
          NTS-KE server on the NTS TCP port and the two parties perform a TLS
          handshake. Via the TLS channel, the parties negotiate some additional
          protocol parameters and the server sends the client a supply of
          cookies along with a list of one or more IP addresses to NTP servers
          for which the cookies are valid. The parties use
          <xref target="RFC5705">TLS key export</xref> to extract key material
          which will be used in the next phase of the protocol. This negotiation
          takes only a single round trip, after which the server closes the
          connection and discards all associated state. At this point the NTS-KE
          phase of the protocol is complete. Ideally, the client never needs to
          connect to the NTS-KE server again.
        </t>
        <t>
          Time synchronization proceeds with one of the indicated NTP servers
          over the NTP UDP port. The client sends the server an NTP client
          packet which includes several extension fields. Included among these
          fields are a cookie (previously provided by the key exchange server)
          and an authentication tag, computed using key material extracted from
          the NTS-KE handshake.  The NTP server uses the cookie to recover this
          key material and send back an authenticated response. The response
          includes a fresh, encrypted cookie which the client then sends back in
          the clear in a subsequent request. (This constant refreshing of
          cookies is necessary in order to achieve NTS's unlinkability goal.)
        </t>
        <t>
          <xref target="protocol-overview"/> provides an overview of the
          high-level interaction between the client, the NTS-KE server, and the
          NTP server. Note that the cookies' data format and the exchange of
          secrets between NTS-KE and NTP servers are not part of this
          specification and are implementation dependent. However, a suggested
          format for NTS cookies is provided in
          <xref target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/>.

        Network Time Security makes use of TLS for NTS key establishment.
      </t>
      <t>
        Since securing time protocols is (as of 2017) a novel
        application of TLS, no backward-compatibility concerns exist
        to justify using obsolete, insecure, or otherwise broken TLS
        features or versions. We therefore put forward the following
        requirements and guidelines, roughly representing 2017's best
        practices.
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS versions
        earlier than 1.2.
      </t>
      <t>
        Implementations willing to negotiate more than one possible
        version of TLS SHOULD NOT respond to handshake failures by
        retrying with a downgraded protocol version. If they do, they
        MUST implement <xref target="RFC7507"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        TLS clients MUST NOT offer, and TLS servers MUST NOT select,
        RC4 cipher suites. <xref target="RFC7465"/>
      </t>
      <t>
        TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD offer, and TLS servers SHOULD accept, the
        <xref target="RFC5746">TLS Renegotiation Indication
        Extension</xref>. Regardless, they MUST NOT initiate or permit
        insecure renegotiation.
      </t>
      <t>
        TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD offer, and TLS 1.2 servers SHOULD accept, the

        Secret Extension</xref>.
      </t>
      <t>
        Use of the <xref target="RFC7301">Application-Layer Protocol

        it is REQUIRED for interoperability.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="The NTS Key Establishment Protocol" anchor="nts-ke">
      <t>
        The NTS key establishment protocol is conducted via TCP port [[TBD1]].
        The two endpoints carry out a TLS handshake in conformance with
        <xref target="tls-profile"/>, with the client offering (via an
        <xref target="RFC7301">ALPN</xref> extension), and the server accepting,
        an application-layer protocol of &quot;ntske/1&quot;. Immediately
        following a successful handshake, the client SHALL send a single request
        as Application Data encapsulated in the TLS-protected channel. Then, the
        server SHALL send a single response followed by a TLS
        &quot;Close notify&quot; alert and then discard the channel state.
      </t>
      <t>
        The client's request and the server's response each SHALL consist of a
        sequence of records formatted according to
        <xref target="ntske-record"/>. Requests and non-error responses each
        SHALL include exactly one NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record. The
        sequence SHALL be terminated by a &quot;End of Message&quot; record. The
        requirement that all NTS-KE messages be terminated by an End of Message
        record makes them self-delimiting.
      </t>
      <t>
        Clients and servers MAY enforce length limits on requests and responses,

        <t>The following NTS-KE Record Types are defined:</t>

        <section title="End of Message" anchor="end-of-message">
          <t>
            The End of Message record has a Record Type number of 0 and a
            zero-length body. It MUST occur exactly once as the final record of
            every NTS-KE request and response. The Critical Bit MUST be set.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="NTS Next Protocol Negotiation"
          anchor="nts-next-protocol-negotiation">
          <t>
            The NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record has a Record Type number
            of 1. It MUST occur exactly once in every NTS-KE request and
            response. Its body consists of a sequence of 16-bit unsigned
            integers in network byte order. Each integer represents a Protocol
            ID from the IANA Network Time Security Next Protocols registry. The
            Critical Bit MUST be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            The Protocol IDs listed in the client's NTS Next Protocol
            Negotiation record denote those protocols which the client wishes to
            speak using the key material established through this NTS-KE
            session. The Protocol IDs listed in the server's response MUST
            comprise a subset of those listed in the request and denote those
            protocols which the server is willing and able to speak using the
            key material established through this NTS-KE session. The client MAY
            proceed with one or more of them. The request MUST list at least one
            protocol, but the response MAY be empty.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Error" anchor="nts-error">
          <t>
            The Error record has a Record Type number of 2. Its body is exactly
            two octets long, consisting of an unsigned 16-bit integer in network
            byte order, denoting an error code. The Critical Bit MUST be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            Clients MUST NOT include Error records in their request. If clients
            receive a server response which includes an Error record, they MUST
            discard any negotiated key material and MUST NOT proceed to the Next
            Protocol.
          </t>
          <t>
            The following error codes are defined:
            <list>
              <t>
                Error code 0 means &quot;Unrecognized Critical Record&quot;. The
                server MUST respond with this error code if the request included
                a record which the server did not understand and which had its
                Critical Bit set. The client SHOULD NOT retry its request
                without modification.
              </t>
              <t>
                Error code 1 means &quot;Bad Request&quot;. The server MUST
                respond with this error if, upon the expiration of an
                implementation-defined timeout, it has not yet received a
                complete and syntactically well-formed request from the client.

        <section title="Warning" anchor="nts-warning">
          <t>
            The Warning record has a Record Type number of 3. Its body is
            exactly two octets long, consisting of an unsigned 16-bit integer in
            network byte order, denoting a warning code. The Critical Bit MUST
            be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            Clients MUST NOT include Warning records in their request. If
            clients receive a server response which includes a Warning record,
            they MAY discard any negotiated key material and abort without
            proceeding to the Next Protocol. Unrecognized warning codes MUST be
            treated as errors.
          </t>
          <t>
            This memo defines no warning codes.

          anchor="aead-algorithm-negotiation">
          <t>
            The AEAD Algorithm Negotiation record has a Record Type number of 4.
            Its body consists of a sequence of unsigned 16-bit integers in
            network byte order, denoting Numeric Identifiers from the IANA
            <xref target="RFC5116">AEAD registry</xref>. The Critical Bit MAY be
            set.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record offers Protocol ID 0
            (for NTPv4), then this record MUST be included exactly once. Other
            protocols MAY require it as well.
          </t>
          <t>
            When included in a request, this record denotes which AEAD
            algorithms the client is willing to use to secure the Next Protocol,
            in decreasing preference order. When included in a response, this
            record denotes which algorithm the server chooses to use. It is
            empty if the server supports none of the algorithms offered. In
            requests, the list MUST include at least one algorithm. In
            responses, it MUST include at most one. Honoring the client's
            preference order is OPTIONAL: servers may select among any of the
            client's offered choices, even if they are able to support some
            other algorithm which the client prefers more.

            15). That is, if the client includes AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256 in its
            AEAD Algorithm Negotiation record and the server accepts Protocol
            ID 0 (NTPv4) in its NTS Next Protocol Negotiation record, then the
            server's AEAD Algorithm Negotiation record MUST NOT be empty.

        <section title="New Cookie for NTPv4" anchor="new-cookie-for-ntpv4">
          <t>
            The New Cookie for NTPv4 record has a Record Type number of 5. The
            contents of its body SHALL be implementation-defined and clients
            MUST NOT attempt to interpret them. See <xref
            target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/> for a suggested
            construction.
          </t>
          <t>
            Clients MUST NOT send records of this type. Servers MUST send at
            least one record of this type, and SHOULD send eight of them, if the
            Next Protocol Negotiation response record contains Protocol ID 0
            (NTPv4) and the AEAD Algorithm Negotiation response record is not
            empty. The Critical Bit SHOULD NOT be set.

          anchor="ntp-server-negotiation">
          <t>
            The NTP Server Negotiation record has a Record Type number of 6. The
            record MAY be sent by a client in a request and SHOULD be sent by a
            server as part of a reply. Its body consists of a sequence of IPv4
            and/or IPv6 addresses. Both address types are represented by 16
            octets in network byte order. To achieve this, IPv4 addresses are
            represented as &quot;IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses&quot; in the format
            specified in <xref target="RFC4291">RFC 4291, Section
            2.5.5.2</xref>. For example: The IPv4 address 192.0.2.1 would be
            mapped to the IPv6 address space as ::ffff:192.0.2.1. The Critical
            Bit SHOULD be set.
          </t>
          <t>
            When used in a request, the NTP Server Negotiation record is the
            client's way of indicating to the KE server which NTP servers it
            wishes to receive cookies for. Honoring the client's NTP server
            preferences is OPTIONAL. When used in a response, this record
            informs the client about which NTP servers the received cookies can
            be used with in the next phase of the protocol. The client SHOULD
            NOT attempt to use the received cookies with any other NTP servers
            than those indicated by the KE server.
          </t>
          <t>
            If a response does not include this record, the client SHOULD assume
            that the received cookies are valid for use with an NTP server at
            the same network address as the key exchange server.

          In general, an NTS-protected NTPv4 packet consists of:
          <list>
            <t>
              The usual 48-octet NTP header, which is authenticated
              but not encrypted.
            </t>
            <t>
              Some extension fields which are authenticated but not encrypted.
            </t>
            <t>
              An extension field which contains AEAD output (i.e., an
              authentication tag and possible ciphertext). The
              corresponding plaintext, if non-empty, consists of some
              extension fields which benefit from both encryption and
              authentication.
            </t>
            <t>
              Possibly, some additional extension fields which are
              neither encrypted nor authenticated. These are discarded
              by the receiver.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          Always included among the authenticated or
          authenticated-and-encrypted extension fields are a cookie
          extension field and a unique-identifier extension field. The
          purpose of the cookie extension field is to enable the
          server to offload storage of session state onto the
          client. The purpose of the unique-identifier extension field
          is to protect the client from replay attacks.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The Unique Identifier extension field">
        <t>
          The Unique Identifier extension field has a Field Type of
          [[TBD2]]. When the extension field is included in a client
          packet (mode 3), its body SHALL consist of a string of
          octets generated uniformly at random. The string MUST be at
          least 32 octets long.  When the extension field is included in a
          server packet (mode 4), its body SHALL contain the same
          octet string as was provided in the client packet to which
          the server is responding. Its use in modes other than
          client-server is not defined.
        </t>
        <t>
          The Unique Identifier extension field provides the client
          with a cryptographically strong means of detecting replayed
          packets. It MAY also be used standalone, without NTS, in
          which case it provides the client with a means of detecting
          spoofed packets from off-path attackers. Historically, NTP's
          origin timestamp field has played both these roles, but for
          cryptographic purposes this is suboptimal because it is only
          64 bits long and, depending on implementation details, most
          of those bits may be predictable. In contrast, the Unique
          Identifier extension field enables a degree of
          unpredictability and collision-resistance more consistent
          with cryptographic best practice.

        <t>
          The NTS Cookie extension field has a Field Type of
          [[TBD3]]. Its purpose is to carry information which enables
          the server to recompute keys and other session state without
          having to store any per-client state. The contents of its
          body SHALL be implementation-defined and clients MUST NOT
          attempt to interpret them. See <xref
          target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/> for a
          suggested construction.  The NTS Cookie extension field
          MUST NOT be included in NTP packets whose mode is other than
          3 (client) or 4 (server).
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="The NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field">
        <t>
          The NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field has a Field Type
          of [[TBD4]].  When this extension field is included in a
          client packet (mode 3), it communicates to the server that
          the client wishes it to send additional cookies in its
          response. This extension field MUST NOT be included in NTP
          packets whose mode is other than 3.
        </t>
        <t>
          Whenever an NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field is
          present, it MUST be accompanied by an NTS Cookie extension
          field, and the body length of the NTS Cookie Placeholder
          extension field MUST be the same as the body length of the
          NTS Cookie extension field. (This length requirement serves
          to ensure that the response will not be larger than the
          request, in order to improve timekeeping precision and
          prevent DDoS amplification). The contents of the NTS Cookie
          Placeholder extension field's body are undefined and, aside
          from checking its length, MUST be ignored by the server.

      <section title="The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields extension field">
        <t>
          The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields extension field is
          the central cryptographic element of an NTS-protected NTP
          packet. Its Field Type is [[TBD5]] and the format of its body
          SHALL be as follows:
          <list>
            <t>
              Nonce length: Two octets in network byte order, giving
              the length of the Nonce field and interpreted as an
              unsigned integer.
            </t>
            <t>
              Nonce: A nonce as required by the negotiated AEAD Algorithm.
            </t>
            <t>
              Ciphertext: The output of the negotiated AEAD
              Algorithm. The structure of this field is determined by
              the negotiated algorithm, but it typically contains an
              authentication tag in addition to the actual ciphertext.
            </t>
            <t>
              Padding: several octets of padding, with every octet set
              to the number of padding octets included, e.g.,
              &quot;01&quot;, &quot;02 02&quot;, or &quot;03 03
              03&quot;. Constraints on the number of padding octets
              included are enumerated below.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The Ciphertext field SHALL be formed by providing the
          following inputs to the negotiated AEAD Algorithm:
          <list>
            <t>
              K: For packets sent from the client to the server, the
              C2S key SHALL be used. For packets sent from the server
              to the client, the S2C key SHALL be used.
            </t>
            <t>
              A: The associated data SHALL consist of the portion of
              the NTP packet beginning from the start of the NTP
              header and ending at the end of the last extension field
              which precedes the NTS Authenticator and Encrypted
              Extension Fields extension field.
            </t>
            <t>
              P: The plaintext SHALL consist of all (if any) NTP
              extension fields to be encrypted. The format of any such
              fields SHALL be in accordance with <xref
              target="RFC7822">RFC 7822</xref>, and if multiple
              extension fields are present they SHALL be joined by
              concatenation.
            </t>
            <t>
              N: The nonce SHALL be formed however required by the
              negotiated AEAD Algorithm.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
	<t>
	  The number of padding octets included SHALL conform to the
	  following constraints:
	  <list>
	    <t>
	      The number MUST be at least 1, so that the final octet
	      of the extension field always gives the padding length.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The number MUST NOT be greater than 255, since high
	      numbers are unrepresentable in a single octet
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      The number MUST result in an extension field length
	      which is legal per <xref target="RFC7822"/>. That is,
	      the number of padding octets must be chosen so that the
	      total length of the extension field (including the Field
	      Type and Length subfields) is a multiple of 4 greater
	      than or equal to 16, and greater than or equal to 28 if
	      the extension field is the last one in the packet.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      For mode 3 (client) packets only, the number MUST be at
	      least MAX(MIN(N_MAX, 16) - N_len, 0) + 4, where `N_len`
	      represents the actual length of the nonce and N_MAX is,
	      per <xref target="RFC5116"/>, the maximum permitted
	      nonce length for the AEAD algorithm in use. This
	      constraint ensures that servers can always use an
	      adequately long nonce without causing the size of their
	      response packet to exceed the size of the request
	      packet. Servers SHOULD enforce this constraint by
	      dropping client packets that do not conform to it.
	      Clients MUST NOT enforce it since it is not binding on
	      mode 4 (server) packets to begin with.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
        <t>
          The NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields
          extension field MUST NOT be included in NTP packets whose
          mode is other than 3 (client) or 4 (server).

    <section title="Protocol details">
        <t>
          A client sending an NTS-protected request SHALL include the
          following extension fields as displayed in  <xref
          target="fig_NTSTimeSyncMessage"/>:
          <list>
            <t>
              Exactly one Unique Identifier extension field, which
              MUST be authenticated, MUST NOT be encrypted, and whose
              contents MUST NOT duplicate those of any previous
              request.
            </t>
            <t>
              Exactly one NTS Cookie extension field, which MUST be
              authenticated and MUST NOT be encrypted. The cookie MUST
              be one which the server previously provided the client;
              it may have been provided during the NTS-KE handshake or
              in response to a previous NTS-protected NTP request.  To
              protect client's privacy, the same cookie SHOULD NOT be
              included in multiple requests. If the client does not
              have any cookies that it has not already sent, it SHOULD
              re-run the NTS-KE protocol before continuing.
            </t>
            <t>
              Exactly one NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension
              Fields extension field, generated using an AEAD
              Algorithm and C2S key established through NTS-KE.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MAY include one or more NTS Cookie Placeholder
          extension field, which MUST be authenticated and MAY be
          encrypted. The number of NTS Cookie Placeholder extension
          fields that the client includes SHOULD be such that if the
          client includes N placeholders and the server sends back N+1
          cookies, the number of unused cookies stored by the client
          will come to eight. When both the client and server adhere
          to all cookie-management guidance provided in this memo, the
          number of placeholder extension fields will equal the number
          of dropped packets since the last successful volley.
        </t>
        <t>
          The client MAY include additional (non-NTS-related)
          extension fields, which MAY appear prior to the NTS
          Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields extension
          fields (therefore authenticated but not encrypted), within
          it (therefore encrypted and authenticated), or after it
          (therefore neither encrypted nor authenticated). In general,
          however, the server MUST discard any unauthenticated
          extension fields and process the packet as though they were
          not present. Servers MAY implement exceptions to this
          requirement for particular extension fields if their
          specification explicitly provides for such.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS-protected request, the server SHALL
          (through some implementation-defined mechanism) use the
          cookie to recover the AEAD Algorithm, C2S key, and S2C key
          associated with the request, and then use the C2S key to
          authenticate the packet and decrypt the ciphertext.  If the
          cookie is valid and authentication and decryption succeed,
          then the server SHALL include the following extension fields
          in its response:
          <list>
            <t>
              Exactly one Unique Identifier extension field, which
              MUST be authenticated, MUST NOT be encrypted, and whose
              contents SHALL echo those provided by the client.
            </t>
            <t>
              Exactly one NTS Authenticator and Encrypted Extension
              Fields extension field, generated using the AEAD
              algorithm and S2C key recovered from the cookie provided
              by the client.
            </t>
            <t>
              One or more NTS Cookie extension fields, which MUST be
              encrypted and authenticated. The number of NTS Cookie
              extension fields included SHOULD be equal to, and MUST
              NOT exceed, one plus the number of valid NTS Cookie
              Placeholder extension fields included in the request.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>
	<t>
	  We emphasize the contrast that NTS Cookie extension fields
	  MUST NOT be encrypted when sent from client to server, but
	  MUST be encrypted from sent from server to client. The
	  former is necessary in order for the server to be able to
	  recover the C2S and S2C keys, while the latter is
	  necessary to satisfy the unlinkability goals discussed in
	  <xref target="Unlinkability"/>. We emphasize also that
	  &quot; encrypted&quot; means encapsulated within the the NTS
	  Authenticator and Encrypted Extensions extension
	  field. While the body of a NTS Cookie extension field will
	  generally consist of some sort of AEAD output (regardless of
	  whether the recommendations of <xref
	  target="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies"/> are precisely
	  followed), this is not sufficient to make the extension
	  field &quot;encrypted&quot;.
	</t>
        <t>
          The server MAY include additional (non-NTS-related)
          extension fields, which MAY appear prior to the NTS
          Authenticator and Encrypted Extension Fields extension field
          (therefore authenticated but not encrypted), within it
          (therefore encrypted and authenticated), or after it
          (therefore neither encrypted nor authenticated). In general,
          however, the client MUST discard any unauthenticated
          extension fields and process the packet as though they were
          not present. Clients MAY implement exceptions to this
          requirement for particular extension fields if their
          specification explicitly provides for such.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the server is unable to validate the cookie or
          authenticate the request, it SHOULD respond with a
          Kiss-o'-Death packet (see <xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905,
          Section 7.4)</xref>) with kiss code &quot;NTSN&quot;
          (meaning &quot;NTS NAK&quot;). Such a response MUST include
          exactly one Unique Identifier extension field whose contents
          SHALL echo those provided by the client.  It MUST NOT
          include any NTS Cookie or NTS Authenticator and Encrypted
          Extension Fields extension fields.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS-protected response, the client MUST
          verify that the Unique Identifier matches that of an
          outstanding request, and that the packet is authentic under
          the S2C key associated with that request. If either of these
          checks fails, the packet MUST be discarded without further
          processing.
        </t>
        <t>
          Upon receiving an NTS NAK, the client MUST verify that the
          Unique Identifier matches that of an outstanding request. If
          this check fails, the packet MUST be discarded without
          further processing. If this check passes, the client SHOULD
          wait until the next poll for a valid NTS-protected response
          and if none is received, discard all cookies and AEAD keys
          associated with the server which sent the NAK and initiate a
          fresh NTS-KE handshake.

    <section title="Suggested format for NTS cookies" anchor="suggested-format-for-nts-cookies">
      <t>
	This section is non-normative. It gives a suggested way for
	servers to construct NTS cookies. All normative requirements
	are stated in <xref target="new-cookie-for-ntpv4"/> and <xref
	target="nts-cookie-extension-field"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The role of cookies in NTS is closely analogous to that of
        session cookies in TLS. Accordingly, the thematic resemblance
        of this section to <xref target="RFC5077">RFC 5077</xref> is
        deliberate, and the reader should likewise take heed of its
        security considerations.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should select an AEAD algorithm which they will use to
        encrypt and authenticate cookies. The chosen algorithm should
        be one such as <xref
        target="RFC5297">AEAD_AES_SIV_CMAC_256</xref> which resists
        accidental nonce reuse, and it need not be the same as the
        one that was negotiated with the client. Servers should
        randomly generate and store a master AEAD key `K`. Servers
        should additionally choose a non-secret, unique value `I` as
        key-identifier for `K`.
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should periodically (e.g., once daily) generate a new
        pair (I,K) and immediately switch to using these values for
        all newly-generated cookies. Immediately following each such
        key rotation, servers should securely erase any keys generated
        two or more rotation periods prior. Servers should continue to
        accept any cookie generated using keys that they have not yet
        erased, even if those keys are no longer current. Erasing old
        keys provides for forward secrecy, limiting the scope of what
        old information can be stolen if a master key is somehow
        compromised. Holding on to a limited number of old keys allows
        clients to seamlessly transition from one generation to the
        next without having to perform a new NTS-KE handshake.
      </t>
      <t>
        The need to keep keys synchronized across load-balanced
        clusters can make automatic key rotation challenging. However,
        the task can be accomplished without the need for central
        key-management infrastructure by using a ratchet, i.e., making
        each new key a deterministic, cryptographically pseudo-random
        function of its predecessor. A recommended concrete
        implementation of this approach is to use <xref
        target="RFC5869">HKDF</xref> to derive new keys, using the
        key's predecessor as Input Keying Material and its key identifier
        as a salt.
      </t>
      <t>
        To form a cookie, servers should first form a plaintext `P`
        consisting of the following fields:
        <list>
          <t>The AEAD algorithm negotiated during NTS-KE</t>
          <t>The S2C key</t>
          <t>The C2S key</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        Servers should then generate a nonce `N` uniformly at random,
        and form AEAD output `C` by encrypting `P` under key `K` with
        nonce `N` and no associated data.
      </t>
      <t>
        The cookie should consist of the tuple `(I,N,C)`.
      </t>
      <t>
        To verify and decrypt a cookie provided by the client, first
        parse it into its components `I`, `N`, and `C`. Use `I` to
        look up its decryption key `K`. If the key whose identifier is
        `I` has been erased or never existed, decryption fails; reply
        with an NTS NAK. Otherwise, attempt to decrypt and verify
        ciphertext `C` using key `K` and nonce `N` with no associated
        data. If decryption or verification fails, reply with an NTS
        NAK. Otherwise, parse out the contents of the resulting
        plaintext `P` to obtain the negotiated AEAD algorithm, S2C key,
        and C2S key.

    <section title="Security considerations">
      <section title="Avoiding DDoS amplification">
        <t>
          Certain non-standard and/or deprecated features of the Network
          Time Protocol enable clients to send a request to a server
          which causes the server to send a response much larger than
          the request. Servers which enable these features can be abused
          in order to amplify traffic volume in distributed
          denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by sending them a request
          with a spoofed source IP. In recent years, attacks of this nature
          have become an endemic nuisance.
        </t>
        <t>
          NTS is designed to avoid contributing any further to this
          problem by ensuring that NTS-related extension fields included in
          server responses will be the same size as the NTS-related
          extension fields sent by the client. In particular, this is why
          the client is required to send a separate and appropriately
          padded-out NTS Cookie Placeholder extension field for every cookie
          it wants to get back, rather than being permitted simply to
          specify a desired quantity.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Due to the <xref target="RFC7822"/> requirement that extensions
	  be padded and aligned to four-octet boundaries, response size
	  may still in some cases exceed request size by up to three
	  octets. This is sufficiently inconsequential that we have
	  declined to address it.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Initial verification of server certificates">
	<t>
	  NTS's security goals are undermined if the client fails to
	  verify that the X.509 certificate chain presented by the
	  server is valid and rooted in a trusted certificate
	  authority. <xref target="RFC5280"/> and <xref
	  target="RFC6125"/> specify how such verification is to be
	  performed in general. However, the expectation that the
	  client does not yet have a correctly-set system clock at the
	  time of certificate verification presents difficulties with
	  verifying that the certificate is within its validity
	  period, i.e., that the current time lies between the times
	  specified in the certificate's notBefore and notAfter
	  fields, and it may be operationally necessary in some cases
	  for a client to accept a certificate which appears to be
	  expired or not yet valid. While there is no perfect solution
	  to this problem, there are several mitigations the client
	  can implement to make it more difficult for an adversary to
	  successfully present an expired certificate:
	  <list>
	    <t>
	      Check whether the system time is in fact unreliable. If
	      the system clock has previously been synchronized since
	      last boot, then on operating systems which implement a
	      kernel-based phase-locked-loop API, a call to
	      ntp_gettime() should show a maximum error less than
	      NTP_PHASE_MAX. In this case, the clock SHOULD be
	      considered reliable and certificates can be strictly
	      validated.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Allow the system administrator to specify that
	      certificates should *always* be strictly validated. Such
	      a configuration is appropriate on systems which have a
	      battery-backed clock and which can reasonably prompt the
	      user to manually set an approximately-correct time if it
	      appears to be needed.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Once the clock has been synchronized, periodically write
	      the current system time to persistent storage. Do not accept
	      any certificate whose notAfter field is earlier than the last
	      recorded time.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Do not process time packets from servers if the time
	      computed from them falls outside the validity period of
	      the server's certificate.
	    </t>
	    <t>
	      Use multiple time sources. The ability to pass off an
	      expired certificate is only useful to an adversary who
	      has compromised the corresponding private key. If the
	      adversary has compromised only a minority of servers,
	      NTP's selection algorithm (<xref target="RFC5905"/>
	      section 11.2.1) will protect the client from accepting
	      bad time from the adversary-controlled servers.
	    </t>
	  </list>
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Usage of NTP pools">
        <t>
	  Additional standardization work and infrastructure
	  development is necessary before NTS can be used with public
	  NTP server pools. First, a scheme will need to be specified
	  for determining what constitutes an acceptable certificate
	  for a pool server, such as establishing a value required to
	  be contained in its Extended Key Usage attribute, and how to
	  determine, given the DNS name of a pool, what Subject
	  Alternative Name to expect in the certificates of its
	  members. Implementing any such specification will
	  necessitate infrastructure work: pool organizers will need
	  to act as certificate authorities, regularly monitor the
	  behavior of servers to which certificates have been issued,
	  and promptly revoke the certificate of any server found to
	  be serving incorrect time.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="DelayAttack" title="Delay attacks">
        <t>
	  In a packet delay attack, an adversary with the ability to
	  act as a man-in-the-middle delays time synchronization
	  packets between client and server asymmetrically <xref
	  target="RFC7384"/>. Since NTP's formula for computing time
	  offset relies on the assumption that network latency is
	  roughly symmetrical, this leads to the client to compute an
	  inaccurate value <xref target="Mizrahi"/>. The delay attack
	  does not reorder or modify the content of the exchanged
	  synchronization packets. Therefore, cryptographic means do
	  not provide a feasible way to mitigate this attack. However,
	  the maximum error that an adversary can introduce is bounded
	  by half of the round trip delay.
	</t>
	<t>
	  <xref target="RFC5905"/> specifies a parameter called
	  MAXDIST which denotes the maximum round-trip latency
	  (including not only the immediate round trip between client
	  and server but the whole distance back to the reference
	  clock as reported in the Root Delay field) that a client
	  will tolerate before concluding that the server is
	  unsuitable for synchronization. The standard value for
	  MAXDIST is one second, although some implementations use
	  larger values. Whatever value a client chooses, the maximum
	  error which can be introduced by a delay attack is
	  MAXDIST/2.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Usage of multiple time sources, or multiple network paths to
	  a given time source <xref target="Shpiner"/>, may also serve
	  to mitigate delay attacks if the adversary is in control of
	  only some of the paths.

      <section title="Random number generation">
        <t>
	  At various points in NTS, the generation of
	  cryptographically secure random numbers is required.
    Whenever this draft specifies the use of random numbers,
    then cryptographically secure random number generation MUST
    be used. See <xref target="RFC4086"/> for guidelines concerning
    this topic.

    <section title="Privacy Considerations">
      <section title="Unlinkability" anchor="Unlinkability">
        <t>Unlinkability prevents a device from being tracked when it changes
        network addresses (e.g. because said device moved between different
        networks). In other words, unlinkability thwarts an attacker that
        seeks to link a new network address used by a device with a network
        address that it was formerly using, because of recognizable data that
        the device persistently sends as part of an NTS-secured NTP
        association. This is the justification for continually supplying the
        client with fresh cookies, so that a cookie never represents
        recognizable data in the sense outlined above. </t>

        <t>NTS's unlinkability objective is merely to not leak any additional
        data that could be used to link a device's network address. NTS does
        not rectify legacy linkability issues that are already present in NTP.
        Thus, a client that requires unlinkability must also minimize
        information transmitted in a client query (mode 3) packet as described
        in the draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization"/>.
        </t>

        <t>The unlinkability objective only holds for time synchronization
        traffic, as opposed to key exchange traffic. This implies that it
        cannot be guaranteed for devices that function not only as time
        clients, but also as time servers (because the latter can be
        externally triggered to send authentication data). </t>

        <t>It should also be noted that it could be possible to link devices
        that operate as time servers from their time synchronization traffic,
        using information exposed in (mode 4) server response packets (e.g.
        reference ID, reference time, stratum, poll).&nbsp; Also, devices that
        respond to NTP control queries could be linked using the information
        revealed by control queries. </t>
        
        <t>Note that the unlinkability objective does not prevent a client device
        to be tracked by its time servers.</t>

      <section title="Confidentiality">
	<t>
	  NTS does not protect the confidentiality of information in
	  NTP's header fields. When clients implement <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization"/>, client packet
	  headers do not contain any information which the client
	  could conceivably wish to keep secret: one field is random,
	  and all others are fixed. Information in server packet
	  headers is likewise public: the origin timestamp is copied
	  from the client's (random) transmit timestamp, and all other
	  fields are set the same regardless of the identity of the
	  client making the request.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Future extension fields could hypothetically contain
	  sensitive information, in which case NTS provides a
	  mechanism for encrypting them.
